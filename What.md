# _What_ is Vyxal?

Vyxal is a golfing language with a unique design philosophy: make things as short as possible but retain elegance while doing so. In very simple terms, this means
keeping aspects of traditional programming languages that most developers are familiar with, while still providing commands that allow golfers to actually _win_
challenges.

Vyxal is _not_ a language which forces users to mash random characters togther until something works. Nor is it a language that needs to be verbose. Vyxal is terse when
it needs to be, and readable/stylish when it wants to be.

Vyxal is also deliberately designed to be an easy language to learn. While it may be possible to teach golfers how to program in Vyxal, it is far more likely that they will just learn through experience. The language is designed to be easy to understand, and to allow for fast and rapid development.

Ultimately, Vyxal is a language for golfers, by golfers.
